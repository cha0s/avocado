### Open source

Peek behind the curtain! See what makes your games work, from the bare metal
all the way to the pretty pictures and everything in between.

Every decision made reflects a commitment to extensibility, modding, and
putting the power and control into your hands. Own your games!

### Ridiculously portable

A primary focus of Avocado is providing an environment that will work across
the plethora of environments where JavaScript can run.

Avocado can run natively and also in HTML5 capable browsers. See the
[avocado-baseline](https://github.com/cha0s/avocado-baseline) project to see
how to get started actually using avocado to make something!

### Hack, hack, hack

Yes, documentation and testing are at this point essentially nonexistent. This
is mostly due to the fact that things are moving quickly. I have infrastructure
in place for both, but I need to get everything synced up. It's on the way!
