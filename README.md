### Open source

Peek behind the curtain! See what makes your games work, from the bare metal
all the way to the pretty pictures and everything in between.

Every decision made reflects a commitment to extensibility, modding, and
putting the power and control into your hands. Own your games!

### Ridiculously portable

Another primary focus of Avocado is providing an environment that will work
identically across the plethora of environments where JavaScript can run.

In adition to this, Avocado provides a robust Service Provider architecture,
allowing the lower level subsystems (like Graphics, Sound, I/O) to be
implemented closer to the platform where your code will run.

### What's up, hackers?

Working away on the fundamentals like testing and structure! Better docs will be coming!

I am trying to create issues outlining things I find important, so that can be
followed to get an idea of what is happening.
